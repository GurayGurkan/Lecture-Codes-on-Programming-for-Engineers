# Lectures on Programming for Engineers

## Course Description

This course serves as an introduction to computing and computational mathematics and gives demonstarations on engineering applications. It aims to help students with little or no programming experience to gain necessary skills to work with abstract notions for solving computational problems. The course is structured around basic topics such as control flow, functions, lists, input and output, simple data structures (sets, dictionaries), data plotting and equation editing. The class will use the Python (2.7.10) programming language as a medium to provide a basic understanding of basic concepts and the students will gain hand-on experience via a set of programming assignments through lab sections and homeworks.
